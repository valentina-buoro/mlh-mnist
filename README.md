# MNIST Handwriting Recognition
## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits (0-9).

Features
- Preprocessing of the MNIST dataset (normalization, reshaping).
- Model evaluation using accuracy metrics.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

The model achieves 95.6% accuracy on the test dataset.
